# OBS Image Manipulation Plugin

An OBS plugin that allows the manipulation of images, via an audio input, in a scene.

This plugin is inspired (and in many senses copies) the obs-image-reaction plugin developed by scaledteam at [obs image reaction plugin](https://github.com/scaledteam/obs-image-reaction). The purpose of this repo is for me to learn about the OBS plugin ecosystem and to learn some C/C++. Another reason for this is because the obs-image-reaction plugin hasn't been compiled for Mac OS and so instead of just building the code on my local machine I decided to try and rewrite the code from scratch....Guess I'm a masochist!

## Goals

My goals for this project are as follows:

1. Create basic plugin template code and get it to compile and show up on OBS
2. Get something to appear on OBS
3. Be able to set properties for plugin (they will do nothing at this stage)
4. Be able to add an image to a scene on OBS
5. Be able to alter the image based on audio input
6. If I get to this point then I'm doing well!
