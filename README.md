# OBS Image Manipulation Plugin

An OBS plugin that allows the manipulation of images, via an audio input, in a scene.

This plugin is inspired (and in many senses copies) the obs-image-reaction plugin developed by [scaledteam](https://github.com/scaledteam) at [obs image reaction plugin](https://github.com/scaledteam/obs-image-reaction). The purpose of this repo is for me to learn about the OBS plugin ecosystem and some C/C++ along the way. Another reason is because the obs-image-reaction plugin hasn't been compiled for macOS (at the time of creating this repo) and so instead of just building the code on my local machine I decided to try and rewrite the code from scratch....guess I'm a masochist!

## Goals
---
My goals for this project are as follows:
1. Create basic plugin template code that compiles without error.
2. Get something to appear on OBS.
3. Be able to set properties for plugin (they will do nothing at this stage).
4. Be able to add an image to a scene on OBS.
5. Be able to alter the image based on audio input.
6. If I get to this point then I'm doing well! ðŸŽ‰


## **Important Notes**
---
- This plugin relies on using OBS Studio code libraries to build. You will need to have a copy of [OBS Studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) downloaded from GitHub and build the code to get the relevant libraries.
- It is assumed that you have CMake installed on your computer. This is need when running the `cmake` and `make` commands.

## Build Plugin
---
To build the plugin follow these steps:
1. In a terminal, run the command:
   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ashmanq/obs-image-manipulation.git
   ```
2. After that has completed, move into the repo directory:
   ```shell
   cd obs-image-manipulation
   ```
3. Create a file in this directory and call it `config.cfg`.
4. In this file put in the following code: 
   ```shell
   OBS_PATH='Replace/with/OBS/code/folder/location'
   ```
   This is the location of the libobs folder on your computer which is where you will have OBS Studio installed. This step is for use on MacOS and might not be required for Linux or Windows (assuming OBS Studio is already installed).
5. Run the build script using command: 
   
   ```shell
   ./build_plugin.sh
   ``` 
   This will run cmake to create the required `MakeFile` in the build directory and will then run the `make` command, which will build the plugin into an .so file.
6. *TODO: Need to add further steps for copying plugin to OBS Studio plugin folder.*
